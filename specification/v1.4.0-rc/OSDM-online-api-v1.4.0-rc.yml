    Specifications for the OSDM API standard. The OSDM specification supports two
    modes of operation: Distributor Mode and Allocator Mode. The API works the same in 
    both mode, except that in allocator mode the API also returns fare information.
    The OSDM specification combines the allocator and distributor modes into one aligned
    API interface.

        If you are searching for fares you pass in the complete trip in trips and the use the returnSearchCriteria

        the offer. 
        Let's consider, as a simplified example, a trip composed of two tripLegs, one with both 1st and 
        2nd class, and one with only 2nd. 
        On this trip, the railway is expected to propose one offer with overallServiceClass FIRST composed 
        of one admission in 1st class on the first tripLegs and one admission in 2nd class on the second one, 
        plus a second offer with overallServiceClass SECOND composed of two second class admissions.
        Likewise for all 'overall' attributes. The purpose of these attributes is to convey to the client
        system the service class, level, flexibility and accommodation that best represent this offer so to
        facilitate presentation to the final user.
