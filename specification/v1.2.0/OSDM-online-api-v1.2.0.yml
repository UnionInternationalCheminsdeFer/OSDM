    Specifications for the OSDM API standard. The OSDM specification supports two
    modes of operation: Distributor Mode and Allocator Mode. The API works the same in 
    both mode, except that in allocator mode the API also returns fare information.
    The OSDM specification combines the allocator and distributor modes into one aligned
    API interface.

        train (between the moment traveller steps on-board until stepping out of that train), but could be using a different means
        of transportation.

        let's consider, as a simplified example, a trip composed of two segments, one with both 1st and 2nd class, and one with only 2nd. 
        On this trip, the railway is expected to propose one offer with overallServiceClass FIRST composed of one admission in 1st class on the first 
        segment and one admission in 2nd class on the second one, plus a second offer with overallServiceClass SECOND composed of two second class admissions.
        Likewise for all 'overall' attributes. The purpose of these attributes is to convey to the client system the service class, level, flexibility and accommodation that best represent this offer so to facilitate presentation to the final user.
