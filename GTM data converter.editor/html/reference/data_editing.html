<h1>Data editing</h1>

<p><ul>
Data are presented in a tree structure where the basic branches are created automatically. Tree branches can be edited by the functions of the context menue on a tree branch to: <br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>add child data</li>
<li>add sibling data</li>
<li>delete data</li>
<li>copy/paste data</li>
<li>validate data</li>.<br/><br/>
</ul>
The tree leaves can be edited in the properties window which is displayed when a tree branch is selected. Text and numeric values can be entered directly, whereas codes are added from listboxes. In case multiple entries are possible a multi-select diaolog will pop up.<br/>

<br/>
Note: Data objects contained in another object are edited via the context menue (e.g. multilanuage text data object within the list of texts), whereas references to such a text object are edited as a leave in the property view via a selection list. (e.g. referenzing a text data object within a fare).</br>
