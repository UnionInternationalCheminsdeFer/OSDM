<h1>Border Point Reference Data</h1>

<p><ul>
Border point reference data describe the border points in the 108.1 legacy data and provide information to create the new 
connection points used in IRS 90918-10. Border points define the border between two tariff areas.<br/><br/>



Border point reference data can be imported from a csv file with the following columns:<br/><br/>


Border point reference data for a border point will be used for conversion only if the data is complete for both involved carriers!<br/><br/>


</ul>

<tr><td>2</td><td>carrier 1</td><td>carrier company code for the carrier on side 1 of the border</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>108 station code 1</td><td>legacy station code (5 digits) of the border point used by carrier 1. This code will be used for the legacy data in a conversion from IRS 90918-10 to the 108.1 format.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>fake MERITS station codes</td><td>list of fake MERITS station codes associated with this border point. The station codes are separated by a "/". Note: These codes are not used for conversion. They are included for a better understanding of the involved codes and the data cleanup at a later stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>station 1</td><td>Merits station code on side 1. The code must indicate a real station with the correct country code where the station is located. In case the station is directly n the border the station code is identical for side 1^and side 2. In case multiple station codes are needed they are separated by a "/". Multiple codes might be needed in case that three lines from different directions join.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>station 2</td><td>Merits station code on side 2. The code must indicate a real station with the correct country code where the station is located. In case the station is directly n the border the station code is identical for side 1^and side 2. In case multiple station codes are needed they are separated by a "/". Multiple codes might be needed in case that three lines from different directions join.</td></tr>
