We are proud to release **Version 3.6** of the
[OSDM Specification](https://osdm.io/spec/). In scope of this increment are
various improvements proposed by the different parties as well as three publicly
available [OSDM sandboxes](https://osdm.io/tools/sandboxes/) **with unified
master data**.

Version 3.6 includes improvements for retail api implementations like the offer overview. The main focus is on 
improving the documentation.

See the [Release Notes 3.6](https://github.com/UnionInternationalCheminsdeFer/OSDM/releases/tag/v3.6) 
for more details.

Furthermore we have a successfully improved **joint test and validation set
ready**. This helps in the adoption of OSDM as well as guarantee that the
implementations are interoperable.

More to come!

Thanks to all the [Team](https://osdm.io/team/) for its hard work.
