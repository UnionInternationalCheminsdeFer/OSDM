We are proud to release **Version 3.2** of the
[OSDM Specification](https://osdm.io/spec/). In scope of this increment are
various improvements proposed by the different parties (Retailers, Distributors,
Railways, Bus Undertakings, Technology Providers).

Focus is to support the Swedish Market which revamps its distribution and
pricing landscape based on OSDM.

See the [Release Notes 3.2](https://osdm.io//releases/OSDM-release-notes-v3.2/)
for more details.

Furthermore we have an initial **joint test and validation set ready**. This
helps in the adoption of OSDM as well as guarantee that the implementations are
interoperable.

More to come!

Thanks to all the [Team](https://osdm.io/team/) for its hard work.
