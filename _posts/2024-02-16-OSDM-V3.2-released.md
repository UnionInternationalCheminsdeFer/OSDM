We are proud to release **Version 3.2** of the
[OSDM Specification](https://osdm.io/spec/). In scope of this increment are
various improvements proposed by the different parties as well as two new
publicly available [OSDM sandboxes](https://osdm.io/tools/sandboxes/).

Focus is to support the Swedish Market which revamps its distribution and
pricing landscape based on OSDM.

See the [Release Notes 3.2](https://osdm.io//releases/OSDM-release-notes-v3.2/)
for more details.

Furthermore we have an initial **joint test and validation set ready**. This
helps in the adoption of OSDM as well as guarantee that the implementations are
interoperable.

More to come!

Thanks to all the [Team](https://osdm.io/team/) for its hard work.
