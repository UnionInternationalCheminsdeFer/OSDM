We are proud to release **Version 3.4** of the
[OSDM Specification](https://osdm.io/spec/). In scope of this increment are
various improvements proposed by the different parties as well as three publicly
available [OSDM sandboxes](https://osdm.io/tools/sandboxes/) **with unified
master data**.

The sandboxes and their data were successfully used for the
[Dreil√§nderhack 2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sibylle-trenck-germann-23299373_osdm-dreilaeunderhack-customerexperience-activity-7247943190006185985-h3Qf)
to build distribution apps in two days. The resulting open **Open Source app**
is currently being polished and will be released soon.

See the [Release Notes 3.4](https://osdm.io//releases/OSDM-release-notes-v3.4/)
for more details.

Furthermore we have a successfully improved **joint test and validation set
ready**. This helps in the adoption of OSDM as well as guarantee that the
implementations are interoperable.

More to come!

Thanks to all the [Team](https://osdm.io/team/) for its hard work.
