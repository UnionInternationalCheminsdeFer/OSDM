# OSDM

The aims of the **Open Sales and Distribution Model (OSDM)** are twofold:

1. to substantially **simplify the booking process for customers** of rail trips and,
2. to **lower complexity and distribution costs** for distributors and railway carriers.

OSDM strengthens rail as a convenient and ecological means of transportation by simplifying distribution. 
Finally, it lays a solid fundament which can be extended to the distribution of other means of transportation.

The OSDM Online API and specification essentially consists of two parts: **Offline Model** and **Online API**.
The Online API works in two modes: **Retailer Mode** and **Distributor Mode**. The Distributor Mode differs 
from the Retailer Mode only in that additionally to **Admissions (aka. Tickets)**, **Reservations** or **Ancillaries** also **Priced segments (aka. Fares)** are offered and can be booked.

The OSDM specification is Open Source and freely available to all parties interested.
The OSDM-Online API is modelled in `YAML`, fully supporting the `REST paradigm`.
