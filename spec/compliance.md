## Compliance

To be compliant with the OSDM specification in total a party must be compliant
with the offline as well as the online part of the specification. However, a
party can decide based on their business need to implement the offline or the
online part online based on the role they want to play in the sales process.

A system receiving data for a fare must be able to understand all features and
rules of the fare defined in the data and obey these features and rules or must
not sell such a fare.

All [non-functional requirements](../non-functional-requirements) defined in the
services must be fulfilled.

On a technical level the implementation must support the Tolerant Reader
pattern. This integration pattern helps creating robust communication systems.
The idea is to be as tolerant as possible when reading data from another
service. This way, when the communication schema changes, the readers must not
break.

An implementation of specification is compliant with the specification if for a
given version

- A feature specified in the data structure is implemented

Or

- A fare providing the feature in its data is excluded from sale

A system receiving data for a fare must be able to understand all features and
rules of the fare defined in the data and obey these features and rules or must
not sell such a fare.
