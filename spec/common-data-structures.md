## Common Data Structures in Offline and Online Mode

The following chapters contain the detailed description of data structures used
to describe fares.

The data structure definitions are used in the bulk data exchange and the online
services. The requirements listed in chapter “Requirements” reference the data
structures that implement the requirement.

### General

The following general data types shall be used:

- DateTime Formats: Date time values must be encoded according to [RFC 3339,
  section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html#section-5.6).
- Station Codes: Station codes must be taken from the TAP TSI retail station
  code list (MERITS).
- Station Names: Station names should not include ”/”,”\*”. These characters are
  used to define routes and alternative routes in route descriptions.

### Versioning

The specification (open api specification and schema files for offline data) are
published as mayor versions in case they are not interoperable. Minor versions
will include interoperable changes on the data structure which also includes
providing additional data elements that are optional. Implementers must be able
to ignore additional elements.

Minor minor versions will include additional documentation only.

### Indication of personal data

Within the online part the required personal data are indicated. The general
grammar to indicate required data is used.

### Indication of required data

Required data are indicated in a structured way using the following language:
Data elements are indicated by their path to the resource separated by dots:

- `passenger.gender`
- `passenger.email`
- `passenger.phoneNumber`

The required data elements can be combined using the logical operators:

- `AND`
- `OR`

Brackets `(` and `)` can be used in the standard way as for logical expressions,
e.g.: `passenger.gender AND (passenger.email OR passenger.phoneNumber)`

#### Detailed data structures

The data structures to be used are defined in the schema and open api
specification files. This section serves as additional documentation only.

### AfterSalesRules

After sales conditions define fees to be taken in case of an after sales
transaction on behalf of a customer. The after sales transactions considered
are:

- Cancellation (= Refund)
- Exchange with a new fare of the same carrier
- Exchange with a new fare of another carrier
- Upgrade

See code list: `TransactionType`

The after sales rules might include rules for a delayed payment to avoid fraud.
This might depend in the type of fulfillment. (e.g. no cash refund on
electronically payed tickets, no refund unless ticket control data have been
received, …).

The refund fee can be claimed by the carrier.

The after sales rules bundle a set of after sales conditions under an id that
can be referenced by a fare.

An after sales condition applies for a set of after sales transactions and
specified:

- the fee to be applied
- the time when the fee needs to be applied
- whether the fee needs to be given to the carrier or can be kept by the
  distributor
- The data include the amount to be refunded. The amount is given to avoid any
  calculations with complex rules (percentage + minimum / maximum value) at the
  distributor side.:
- The value and currency to be applied
- A percentage for customer information. Due to rounding errors a calculated
  percentage could result in strange numbers (e.g. 9.99% instead of 10%)
- The unit on which the value is calculated (travellers or bookings) The time
  when the fee needs to be applied is defined by:
- The time unit (hours, minutes, ...)
- The time difference value
- The time reference (before departure…)

See code lists: `TimeReference`, `TimeUnit`

An after sales fee is applied from a time before departure, after sale,..)

In case multiple rules apply to the same after sales transaction the rule with
the closest time in the future must be applied.

#### Data Constraints on AfterSaleRule

| Code                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fee/feeRef`                               | In online services a fee is included directly, in bulk data exchange a fee must be included in the list of prices and referenced by an id. The fee provided must include the currency € if not agreed bilaterally otherwise. |
| `applicationTime` / `applicationTimeStamp` | An application time stamp can be used in online services only. If an application time stamp is provided the application time as relative time must not be included.                                                          |

### Calendar

A Calendar is referenced by a unique id which can be referenced from other data
structures linked to the fare. A Calendar defines a list of days between two
dates. If the dates are not provided in UTC the offset to UTC must be provided
additionally.

<!-- Figure 4 Calendar data structure -->

![Calendar](../images/common-data-structures/calendar.png)

#### Data Constraints on Calendar

| Code                    | Description                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fromDate`, `untilDate` | fromDate and untilDate must be provided and `fromDate <= untilDate` |
| `dates`                 | `fromDate` <= `date` <= `untilDate`                                 |

### CarrierConstraint

Carrier constraint limits an open fare - not linked to a train - to some
carriers. The carriers can be specified either as exclusion list or
alternatively as inclusion list. In case of admissions (train linked or
non-train linked) the included carriers specify the responsible carriers to be
listed for the customer on an fulfillment.

Carriers are specified by their Company code (RICS code).

<!-- Figure 5 carrier constraint data structure (offline) -->

![Carrier Constraint Type](../images/common-data-structures/carrier-constraint-type.png)

The included / excluded carriers are also part of the FCB barcode (_IRS
90918-4_) content and the ticket control data (_IRS 90918-9_).

The offline data structure includes an additional id to reference the constraint
within a fare data delivery.

#### Data Constraints on CarrierConstraint

| Code                                | Description                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `includedCarriers/excludedCarriers` | Either a list of included or a list of excluded carriers must be provided. It is not allowed to provide both lists. |

### ConnectionPoint

A connection point defines a point where two regional validities of different
carriers can be connected. A connection point is implemented as the list of
stations which hit connects.

In case a route ends at a real station the connection point includes the real
station.

In case the combination is not at a real station an indication is needed to
define the allowed combinations. This could be done by listing the next stations
of other carriers which would allow a combination. Combinations would be allowed
if the combination points of two routes share two common stations.

This would also work with multiple stations.

Connection points will include a border point code to support existing
implementations where the border point code is compared with the timetable data.
As in principle every station can become a connection point (e.g. all stops from
Aachen to Brussels are connection points from `DB` to `SNCB`) implementations
based on border point codes cannot cover all connections.

As on both sides of a connection multiple small stations could be connected and
not all of them might be in the timetable of a train the connections point
should allow to connect sets of stations.

1. Two fares can be connected in case their connection points share a common
   station in the provided station sets if only one set is provided by a
   connection point.
2. Two fares can be connected in case their connection points share a common
   station in two if the provided station sets of each connection point.

<!-- Figure 6 connection points - simple case 1 -->

<!-- Figure 7 connection points - complex case 2 -->

### FareCombinationConstraint

The fare combination constraint defines the rules of combining fares from
different carriers. It provides a list of combination models the distributor can
choose of.

<!-- Figure 10 fare combination constraint data structure -->

![Fare Combination Model](../images/common-data-structures/fare-combination-model.png)

<!-- Figure 11 fare combination constraint data structure -->

![Fare Combination Constraint](../images/common-data-structures/fare-combination-constraint.png)

#### Combination Model

##### SEPARATE_CONTRACT Model

This `SEPARATE_CONTRACT` model is the model for not combining the fares in one
ticket and not allowing the integration in one contract. The rules applied for
this ticket are exactly the rules defined by the carrier in the fare data.

The distributor must ensure that it is clear for the customer that no common
contract was established.

##### CLUSTERING Model

The `CLUSTERING` model tries to simplify conditions and fares for the customer
but sacrifices a part of the control of the carrier on his fares.

Similar types of fares are defined to belong to the same cluster. The after
sales conditions for a cluster are defined by the distributor. However, the
after sales conditions must basic rules on after sales for that cluster.

The clusters correspond to the flexibility a passenger receives to change the
booked train. This corresponds directly to the after sales conditions. Hereby
the fees to be paid for such an exchange are essential for the definition of
clusters and not the complexity of the process to change. Thus, a train bound
ticket and an open ticket belong to the same cluster in case the fees to change
to different trains / times are comparable.

The after sales fees can be demanded by the carrier.

The other conditions might either be listed per carrier or combined by rules.

The customer buying products from one distributor has a simple unique view on
after sales conditions.

The basic parameters defining the price must be obeyed individually within
separately on the combined fare/offer:

- route description / train link
- class of service
- passenger types

##### COMBINING Model

The `COMBINING` model tries to be close to the fare conditions defined by the
carrier but sacrifices the simplicity of the fare towards the customer.

The after sales conditions of the different fares will be combined into one
condition to reflect the conditions of all included carriers.

The after sales conditions will thus depend on the combinations of carriers.

At any time, the after sales fees defined by the carriers are applied on the
price part of these carriers only. The result is a list of times with increasing
fees.

###### COMBINING Model Example

- Carrier 1: 10% 20 days before departure. Price: 100€
- Carrier 2: 90% 2 days before departure. Price: 200 €
- Result:
  - 10€ fee: 20 days before departure
  - 190€ fee: 2 days before departure

#### Additional Clustering Model Data

Fare clusters reflect the flexibility a fare provides to the customer.
Flexibility is defined by the after sales conditions that apply when a passenger
wants to change his ticket.

| Fare cluster code | description                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BUSINESS`        | Refundable/Exchangeable after the departure or last day of validity                                   |
| `FULL_FLEX`       | Refundable/Exchangeable before the departure or last day of validity                                  |
| `SEMI_FLEX`       | Refundable/Exchangeable with fee depending on conditions of the distributor. Minimum validity applies |
| `NON_FLEX`        | Non refundable. Non exchangeable. Minimum validity applies                                            |
| `PROMO`           | Used on a bilateral basis only. Non refundable. Non exchangeable. Minimum validity applies            |

Combinations of fares of different clusters is allowed with the fare clusters
listed in `allowedClusters`. However not all combinations would be provided to
the customer. A fare will be combined with a fare of the same cluster and in
case his is not available with one of the higher clusters.

##### Clustering Model Example

- Carrier 1:

  - `BUSINESS` -> CombinableClusters: `BUSINESS`, `FULL_FLEX`, `SEMI_FLEX`,
    `NON_FLEX`
  - `SEMI_FLEX` -> CombinableClusters: `SEMI_FLEX`, `NON_FLEX`

- Carrier 2:

  - `BUSINESS` -> CombinableClusters: `BUSINESS`, `FULL_FLEX`, `SEMI_FLEX`,
    `NON_FLEX`
  - `FULL_FLEX` -> CombinableClusters: `FULL_FLEX`, `SEMI_FLEX`, `NON_FLEX`

Possible combined offers are:

- `BUSINESS` (Carrier 1 `BUSINESS` + Carrier 2 `BUSINESS`)
- `FULL_FLEX` (Carrier 1 `BUSINESS` + Carrier 2 `FULL_FLEX`)
- `SEMI_FLEX` (Carrier 1 `SEMI_FLEX` + Carrier 2 `FULL_FLEX`)

A `NON_FLEX` would be formally allowed, but with the same price as the
`SEMI_FLEX` so it should not be shown to the customer:

- `NON_FLEX` (Carrier 1 `SEMI_FLEX` + Carrier 2 `FULL_FLEX`)

Other combinations would also be formally allowed by the data but suppressed as
they would only offer a higher price. These should be suppressed by the
distributor. E.g.:

- `FULL_FLEX` (Carrier 1 `BUSINESS` + Carrier 2 `BUSINESS`)

#### Data Constraints on FareCombinationConstraint

| Code               | Description                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `combinationModel` | At least one model must be provided |

### FareResourceLocation

Fare resource location provides data on where to find online services for fares.
The fare location provides three options:

- Link a resource to a carrier – the carrier must be known from the timetable
- Link a resource to the train – the data must be updated in case of new trains
- Link a resource to stations:
  - The link can be made for stations and for connection points
  - The link is valid if start and end station (or connection points) provide
    the link

The online link provides information on:

- The type of resource either for a whole train of an area. In case of a train
  the request must be for the train route between stations (e.g. IRT), whereas
  for areas there might be multiple splits in-between a train run (e.g. NRT).

#### Graphics Icons

Graphic icons are used to display a coach including its facilities based on the
coach layout and availability of places. The graphical items include frames and
icons to display seats etc. Graphical items must be provided by the sales
application of the issuer application to ensure a unique look and feel of the
application.

The coach layout provides only the position of graphic items (co-ordinates) not
the graphical presentation at the sales application (pictures).

A large table spans two places, whereas a small table spans only one place. A
small wall spans two places and a large wall spans 3 places. A very small wall
spans one place only.

#### Data constraints on FareResourceLocation

| Code     | Description                                                            |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `System` | For reservation interface 90810-1 the reservation system code is used. |

### FareReferenceStationSet

The fare reference station set defines a set of stations where the fare is valid
for all included stations. This set can be used in the regionalValidity
description.

The corresponding bar code ab ticket control data will only contain the code of
the station set, but the distributor needs the complete list of station to link
the fare to the train routes.

A name can be provided.

The station set is referenced by the company code of the fare provider and a
code unique within the fare provider.

A `legacyCode` can be provided to include the current code in the 108.1 data.

### FulfillmentConstraint

The fulfillment constraint limits the applicable types of fulfillment and
defined whether control data need to be transferred via a standard interface
(_IRS 90918-4_).

### ReductionConstraint

A fare associated with this constraint requires one of the listed cards to be
presented by the passenger on the trip. Card Ids can be taken from the listed
cards provided within the fare data delivery or from the common code list in
Reduction “cards”.

<!-- Figure 29 ReductionCardReference data structure -->

![Reduction Card Reference](../images/common-data-structures/reduction-card-reference.png)

### RegionalConstraint

Definition of a regional validity of a fare. The regional validity constraint is
defined by an entry connection point and an exit connection point to combine
this regional validity with other regional validities of other carriers and the
specification of the regional validity that is used and described in _IRS
90918-4_ for ticket control. The entry or exit connection point might be missing
in case the fare cannot be combined or can be combined on one side only.

| Content                | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `entryConnectionPoint` | Defines the connection point for connecting this fare at the start of regional validity (see ConnectionPoint)                                                |
| `exitConnectionPoint`  | Defines the connection point for connecting this fare at the start of regional validity (see ConnectionPoint)                                                |
| `regionalValidity`     | Definition of the regional validity as defined in _IRS 90918-4_. It provide data structures for zones, Lines, train links, geographical polygons and routes. |

The connection points are included for combining regions. When combining two
regional validities from two carriers the connection points will disappear in
the combined data structure for bar codes and ticket control and from the
textual description for the passenger.

E.g.:

- Carrier 1: RegionalConstraint {Exit (A,B), RegionalValidity X – Y/Z- A}
- Carrier 2: RegionalConstraint {Entry (A,B), RegionalValidity B – C/D – E}
- _Result_: `X*Y/Z*A*B*C/D*E`

The distributor might need to remove doubled stations in routes in case the
connection point is a real station used in both regional validity descriptions
in case it is displayed as one combined text:

- Carrier 1: RegionalConstraint {Exit (A), RegionalValidity X – Y/Z- A}
- Carrier 2: RegionalConstraint {Entry (A), RegionalValidity A – C/D – E}
- _Result_: `X*Y/Z*A*A*C/D*E` --> `X*Y/Z*A*C/D*E`

#### Connecting Regional Validity to Trips

The regional constraint is connected to the timetable via the regional validity,
the connection points are used to combine regional constraints.

To support legacy implementations the connection points can provide a border
point code linked with the timetable.

<!-- Figure 30 Connection points and timetable routes -->

![Connection Points and Timetable Routes](../images/common-data-structures/connection-points-timetable-routes.png)

<!-- Figure 31 Regional validity constraint data structure -->

![Regional Constraint](../images/common-data-structures/regional-constraint.png)

The online data structure will not use the id and will directly include the
entry and exit connection point, whereas the offline structure will include the
id of the connection point pointing to a connection point within the same data
delivery.

The regional validity contains also content that is applicable to synchronous
data transfer only (e.g. train links for train bound offers).

The data structure `RegionalValidity` is defined in _IRS 90918-4_ and included
by reference only. It provides a sequential list of region definitions that can
be defined as zones, lines, train links (online version only) geographical areas
(polygons) and route descriptions (via-stations). The route description is
extended to include fare reference station sets within the route.

<!-- Figure 32 regional validity data structure -->

### ReservationParameter

ReservationParameter provide data on how to combine reservations with NRT fares,
how to book reservations via the _IRS 90918-1_ interface and which options a
passenger has for reservation.

| Code                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `reservationRequired`        | A reservation must be made accompanying an NRT ticket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `reservationParameters981-1` | Parameters to request the correct reservation using the interface according to _IRS 90918-1_.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `reservationOptions`         | Reservation options available that would not change the offer (same price and conditions) (e.g. Aisle or Window). The information is static and does not mean that such an option is still available. The preferences are grouped in case a selection is required (Aisle or Window). |

### StationDetail

Details on stations including codes and names. Codes must include the MERITS
code in case it is defined for a station.

<!-- Figure 38 structure Station detail data -->

### Text

Used for all textual descriptions where translations might be needed.

<!-- Figure 41 structure Translation Data Structure -->

![Translation](../images/common-data-structures/translation.png)

### ServiceClass

Service class provides textual descriptions for the predefined service classes.

<!-- Figure 44 structure Service Class -->

![Service Constraint](../images/common-data-structures/service-class-definition.png)

### ServiceConstraint

The service constraint limits a fare to specific service brands (train types).
The constraint can either be defined as a list of service brands included or as
a list of service brands excluded for the fare.

The online data structure will not provide the id.

#### Data Constraints on ServiceConstraint

| Code                                             | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `includedServiceBrands`, `excludedServiceBrands` | Only one of the lists can be used. Using both lists is forbidden. |

### ServiceLevel

The service level data provide additional information (e.g. text) in the offline
data exchange in case the reservation API of _IRS 90918-1_ is used.

Description of a service level. The service level defines a specific product on
a train which can have a price (e.g. Double places with shower, …). It is more
specific than just the classic travel class.

The available service levels are defined in _IRS 90918-1_ element 308 (Service
level code). The data indicate the service class that needs to be booked in case
the reservation is not an IRT and parameters needed for reservation via the _IRS
90918-1_ interface.

Some service levels might require a mandatory reservation.

Additional to a service level there might be reservation options that do not
affect the price. There are listed in reservation options. (e.g. Upper or lower
berth in the service level for double Sleeper compartment).

### TravelValidityConstraint

The travel validity constraint defines at which times the passenger is permitted
to travel.

| Code                 | Description                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `excludedTimeRange`  | `from` time < `until` time        |
| `numberOfTravelDays` | A duration must be provided       |
| `returnConstraint`   | `earliestReturn` < `latestReturn` |

### ZoneDefinition

Definition of zones used in regional validity.

The area of a zone can be defined by either a list of stations, geographical
polygon of a list of NUTS codes. Multiple definitions are allowed in case they
define the same area.
