The [OSDM specification](./) is structured into two parts sharing common data
structures:

## Common Data Structures

The [Common Data Structures](./common-data-structures/) are shared between the
Offline Model and the Online API. Here, of special interest is the
[relationships between offers, offerparts, products and fares](./relationship-offer-offerpart-product-and-fare/).

## Part I: Offline Model

The [Offline Model](./offline-model/) defines how the offline data can be
exchanged.

## Part II: Online API

The **OnlineAPI** is explained in these documents:

- [Technical Principles](./technical-principles/)
- [Models](./models/)
- [Processes](./processes/)
- [Pagination](./pagination/)
- [Errors & Warnings](./errors-warnings/)
- [Synchronization](./synchronization/)

## Catalog of Code Lists

A [Catalog of Code Lists](./catalog-of-code-lists/) defines attributes and
provides references to standards used.

## Business Requirements

Business needs leading to this specification are captured in the
[requirement](./requirements/) and the
[business capabilities](./business-capabilities/) documents.

## Compliance to the Specification

In order for an implementation to be compliant, depending on its role, a set of
service need to be implemented as lined out in the [Compliance](./compliance/)
section.

## Availability as UIC Leaflet

The specification is also available as
[IRS-90918-10 Leaflet](https://github.com/UnionInternationalCheminsdeFer/OSDM/blob/master/specification/v3.2/IRS-90918-10-v3.2.0.pdf).
