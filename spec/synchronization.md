## Synchronization

For carriers or distributors to inform retailers about changes in a trip or a
booking, we have added an API that a carrier or distributor system can inform a
retailer about that fact, that a trip or a booking has changed. The retailer can
then itself inform a passenger or the purchaser e.g. a travel agency about
changes to the trip, the booking or the complaint.

The API informs authorized listener of the fact that changes have occurred using
[Webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook).

## Event Types and Their Semantics

### Booking

- `BOOKING_TRIP_CONFIRMED`

  A trip related to the booking which was uncertain has been confirmed. For
  large groups it is possible to book before the train is actually available.

  event up. If final partner, inform the client. You may want to re-confirm the
  client is traveling and if relevant trigger confirmation the payment process.

- `BOOKING_TRIP_CHANGED`

  A trip which was booked (but has not departed yet) has had its schedule
  updated. Thus, it does not cover real-time updates. The trip on the level of
  that provider is still feasible.

  The recommended action is to reload the booking from this provider. If part of
  a multi-provider trip, check the total trip is still feasible and bubble the
  event up. If final partner, inform the client.

- The end point the events need to be sent to. E.g.
  `https://trainline.com/api/webhooks/db`
- Sign message to guarantee that the sender is in fact who it claims to be. E.g.
  `HMAC`
- IP whitelist
