sales and after sales scenarios. Here the general flow is listed, and the
supporting services of the fare exchange are indicated as well as other services
of UIC specifications.

### Distribution Scenario – Sales

#### Timetable Search

Timetable data are not in the scope of this specification. It is assumed, that
the distributor has retrieved a valid travel solution from a timetable search
engine before requesting fares.

#### Offer

Requesting fares of a carrier or train for a specified set of passengers.
Splitting of the entire travel solution into appropriate parts is the task of
the distributor. Data supporting the selection of the carriers/fare providers to
be requested are part of this specification and can be transferred beforehand.

The carrier should deliver all applicable fares for the requested offer and the
rules for combining them.

The prices provided within the offer might be fixed for a specific time range
depending on the fare, but this is not mandatory. Some carriers don’t guarantee
prices at all.

In case of offers with reservation the offer reply will contain the availability
of the different fares and services, but no availability on other place features
(e.g. window, aisle, ...) if they don’t affect the price.

In case a trip description needs to be change as the carrier/ fare provider has
more accurate data on the trip the reply contains a new trip and an indication
of change.

service is used.

as the preliminary booking must be implemented by the distributor receiving the
reservation by cancelling the allocated fare and places in due time and with a
specific reason for cancellation.

features. The fare data of the offer defined in this specification will provide
these data to allow an integration with the existing services of reservation
systems.
