# Errors and Problems

## General HTTP error codes and generic situations <a name="GeneralHTTPerrorcodesandgenericsituations">

The following standard HTTP error codes are used in the specification:

| **Error Code** | **Description**       |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| `400`          | Bad request           |
| `401`          | Unauthorized          |
| `403`          | Forbidden             |
| `404`          | Not found             |
| `405`          | Method not allowed    |
| `409`          | Conflict              |
| `429`          | Too many requests     |
| `500`          | Internal server error |
| `501`          | Not implemented       |
| `503`          | Service unavailable   |

## Functional Errors <a name="FunctionalErrors">

The OSDM API makes use of the JSON Problem structure to return information about
functional errors in the handling of a request. The problem structure is defined
in [RFC9457](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9457) which defines a way to carry
machine-readable details of errors in a HTTP response to avoid the need to
define new error response formats for HTTP APIs.

For OSDM, the following properties are supported:

| **Property** | **Description**                                                                                                                                              | **Mandatory** |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| `code`       | The `code` property should begin with the code of the error type                                                                                             | yes           |
| `title`      | Short, human-readable summary of the problem type which **should not** change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem.                                  | yes           |
| `type`       | An absolute URI that identifies the problem type. When dereferenced, it SHOULD provide human-readable documentation for the problem type (e.g., using HTML). | yes           |
| `detail`     | Human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem                                                                                        | no            |
| `status`     | The HTTP status code generated by the origin server for this occurrence of the problem.                                                                      | no            |

A problem message is typically made of a code, title and a detail. The title and
detail are not translated and the expected language there should be in English.
It is up to the implementers to foresee a translation based on the code if
relevant. Optionally, a problem message can contain reference to resources in
the model.

The list of all error codes that can be returned by the API, needs to exposed on
an URI:

`https://<host>/errors/<error-code>`

where host denotes the host of the API.

### Examples <a name="Examples">

No result found for given request

```json
"problem": {
  "code": "urn:uic:problem:NO_RESULTS",
  "type": "https://osdm.io/errors/no-results",
  "title": "The search did not return any result",
  "detail": "The place `Duckburg` could not be found",
  "status": 404,
}
```

Request not conform OpenAPI schema

```json
"problem": {
  "code": "urn:uic:problem:MALFORMED_REQUEST",
  "type": "https://osdm.io/errors/malformed_request",
  "title": "Request failed schema validation",
  "detail": "The request does not validate the OSDM OpenAPI schema specification",
  "status": 400,
}
```

Request with invalid input

```json
"problem": {
  "code": "urn:uic:problem:VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "type": "https://provider.domain/osdm/documentation/errors/validation_error",
  "title": "Passenger details missing",
  "detail": "The passenger does not contain all mandatory information to confirm the booking",
  "status": 400,
}
```

## Standardized Technical Errors <a name="StandardizedTechnicalErrors">

In order that OSDM implementations behave consistently in error situations, the
following error codes must be supported in case of technical errors by all
implementations:

| `VALIDATION_ERROR`        | The request contains incorrect information                                                    |

| `UNAUTHORIZED`            | Client is no authorized                                                                       |

The lists can be extended by an implementor but at least these errors must be
captured and they must be presented with the codes listed here above.

In case they wish to pass additional problems specific to their situation and
not covered by any of the case below, they can do so by replacing the OSDM
namespace with custom namespace starting with an `X_` followed by an unique
identifier for the provider (ex: `X_NVS_NOMEAL`).

# Warnings

In addition to errors, a generic warnings mechanism is used toÂ pass non-blocking
information or events, such as a price difference with the initially offered
price at booking time to the caller.

A warning message is typically made of a code and a detail. The details are not
translated and the expected language there should be in English. It is up to the
implementers to foresee a translation based on the code if relevant. Optionally,
a warning message can contain reference to resources in the model.

```json
"warning": {
  "code": "PLACE_PROPERTY_NOT_RESPECTED",
  "type": "https://osdm.io/warnings/place-property-not-respected",
  "title": "Place property not respected",
  "detail": "Place property `WINDOW` is not respected in offer with id `123456`",
}
```

## Standardized Functional Warnings <a name="StandardizedFunctionalWarnings">

In order that OSDM implementations behave consistently in warning situations,
the following warning codes must be supported in case of functional warnings by
all implementations:

| **Functional area** | **Warning Code**               | **Title**                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Reservation         | `PLACE_PROPERTY_NOT_RESPECTED` | Place property not respected              |
| Offers              | `OFFER_NO_RESULTS`             | The trip search did not return any result |
| Booking             | `OVERRULE_CODE_NOT_ACCEPTED`   | The overrule code provided was not accepted |
| Booking             | `OVERRULE_CODE_NOT_SUPPORTED`  | The overrule code provided is not supported |
| todo                | `todo`                         | todo                                      |

As for the warnings, an implementor is required to use these warning codes and
descriptions for the situations identified in order to be compliant.

In case they wish to pass additional warnings specific to their situation and
not covered by any of the case below, they can do so by replacing the OSDM
prefix with an `X_` followed by an unique identifier for the provider (ex:
`X_NVS_NOMEAL`).

## Dealing with Unsupported Parameters in Requests <a name="DealingwithUnsupportedParametersinRequests">

Some OSDM requests potentially support a large number of parameters (e.g.
filters). Supporting all of them is not always possible, e.g. due restrictions
of the underlying systems. Thus the following rule applies:

- If the parameter is required, return an _error_ "PARAMETER_NOT_SUPPORTED".
- If the parameter is optional, return a _response_ including a _warning_
  indicating that the optional request parameter was ignored.
