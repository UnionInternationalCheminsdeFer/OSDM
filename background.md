## History of OSDM

The Open Sales and Distribution Model has emerged from the **new Tariff Model
(nTM)** and [Full Service Model (FSM 2.0)](https://tsga.eu/fsm) initiatives:

- The initiative new Tariff Model (nTM) initiated by UIC established the
  successor standard of **PRIFIS**. It defines on the one hand an offline
  standard for the exchange of priced segments (formerly: **PRIFIS series**) and
  on the other hand a new online standard for the purchase of dynamically priced
  segments. The priced segments are calculated and provided by so-called fare
  providers. The priced segments are fetched by an distributor which combines
  these priced segments into a consistent offer and later into a booking and
  ticket. Essentially, this process allows the vision of _"one trip - one ticket
  within Europe"_ to materialize.

- The [Full Service Model (FSM 2.0)](https://tsga.eu/fsm) initiative defines an
  open standard for the distribution of rail services (bookings, reservations,
  integrated reservations and additional services) within Europe and beyond. By
  standardizing the distribution interface, the distribution of products and
  services can be greatly simplified.

To join forces and represent the **public transport sector as a whole** the two
initiatives have been merged into this initiative.
