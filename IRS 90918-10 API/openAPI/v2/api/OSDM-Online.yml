  version: 0.9.9
  description: |
    Specifications for the OSDM API standard. The OSDM specification supports two
    modes of operation: Distributor Mode and Allocator Mode. The API works the same in 
    both mode, except that in allocator mode the API also returns fare information.
    The OSDM specification combines the allocator and distributor modes into one aligned
    API interface.
