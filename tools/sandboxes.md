## Aim

Various providers and distributors built demo or sandbox environments to provide
implementing or interested parties with access to _working prototypes_ or _near
to real-life implementations_ to study the behavior and semantics of the OSDM
API.

These environments are usually registration-only and interested parties are
provided with documentation of the content of the API as well as with examples
of requests to try.

## Sqills OSDM Sandbox

The first OSDM Sandbox was kindly provided by [Sqills](https://www.sqills.com)
and is open to _any party_ interested in implementing OSDM. It is built on top
of the S3 Passenger platform. It supports various virtual routes and services
located in Western Europe, and UK.

To register an account, please send an email including your name, role, company
and a brief explanation of your interest in OSDM to
[support-osdm@sqills.com ](mailto:support-osdm@sqills.com). Detailed
documentation of the content of the API will be provided along with the
credentials.

## Bileto OSDM Sandbox

Bileto officially provides an OSDM Sandbox running the edge version of its OSDM
implementation. The content corresponds to data distributed by the real carriers
of the API. The sandbox provides data from Central Europe.

To be granted access, please register at [osdm.cz](https://osdm.cz). Bileto
provides example client credentials to access the environment, a Postman
collection with examples as well as the documentation of content and local
specifics implemented in the OSDM API.

## benerail OSDM Sandbox

Benerail is a system provider for SNCB, NS, CFL and DSB with a focus on
international and long distance rail tickets and has launched
an [benerail OSDM sandbox](https://benerail.com/sandbox_osdm_api/).

The OSDM API provides integrations between different roles, for example, between
retailer and distributor or between distributor and fare provider - nowadays also
referred to as carrier provider. Benerail, as a technical supplier, has the
ambition to support both the distributor and fare provider role.

The sandbox is designed as an experimental playground, and we welcome you to
access it, share ideas and collaborate with us. You can submit a request to
access our sandbox. You will receive credentials, documentations, a Postman
project and in future a developer portal with more information.

The link to our form is available on
[benerail OSDM sandbox](https://benerail.com/sandbox_osdm_api/).
