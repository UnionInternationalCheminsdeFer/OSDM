## Aim

Various providers and distributors built demo or sandbox environments to provide implementing or interesting parties  with access to _working prototypes_ or _near to real-life implementations_ to study the behavior and semantics of the OSDM API.

These environments are usually registration-only and interested parties are provided with documentation of the content of the API as well as with examples of requests to try.

### Sqills OSDM Sandbox

The first OSDM Sandbox was kindly provided by [Sqills](https://www.sqills.com) and is open to _any party_ interested in implementing OSDM. It is built on top of the S3 Passenger platform. It supports various virtual routes and services located in Western Europe, and UK.

To register an account, please send an email including your name, role, company
and a brief explanation of your interest in OSDM to
[support-osdm@sqills.com ](mailto:support-osdm@sqills.com). Detailed documentation of the content of the API will be provided along with the credentials.
